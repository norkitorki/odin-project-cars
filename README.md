# Odin Project: Cars

This is the [Odin Project: Cars](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-stimulus#exercises) project as part of the exercises for the Stimulus lesson of the Ruby On Rails course.

This project consists of a very simple stimulus controller located at ``` app/javascript/controllers/input_controller.js ``` which allows the adding and removing of form input fields via javascript.
